[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabrihud/) | [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabrihud)

### Requirements
- Minecraft `>1.19.2`
- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) `>0.14.8` or the equivalent [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) version
- [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) `>4.0.0`  
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-language-kotlin) `>1.8.2`

Though not strictly required, ModMenu is the only way to access the configuration UI.  

### Elements 
FabriHUD provides a variety of HUD "elements" These include:
- In-game time 
- Player Coordinates
- Server Latency (Ping)
- FPS 
- Current Biome  
- Ambient Light
  
It's pretty easy to add more, so if you want something custom, chances are I'd be willing to add it (within reason though).  
  
#### Customizability 
Each element can be toggled on and off and positioned independently wherever you want.   

#### Overrides 
"Overrides" allow you to further customize the output, including colors, base text, and more.   
More information about element overrides can be found [here](https://github.com/trainb0y/FabriHUD/blob/main/Overrides.md).  

### Future Plans
- MSPT Element? (avg/min/max)
- TPS Element?
- Look into overrides with colors  making the text entries act up
