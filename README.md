t)  ### Requirements
- Minecraft `>1.19.2`
- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) `>0.14.8` or the equivalent [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) version
- [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) `>4.0.0`  
- Though not strictly required, ModMenu is the only way to access the configuration UI.  

### Elements 
FabriHUD provides a variety of HUD "elements" These include:
- In-game time 
- Player Coordinates
- Server Latency (Ping)
- FPS 
- Current Biome  
  
It's pretty easy to add more, so if you want something custom, chances are I'd be willing to add it (within reason though).  
  
#### Customizability 
Each element can be toggled on and off and positioned independently wherever you want.   

#### Overrides 
"Overrides" allow you to further customize the output, including colors, base text, and more.   
More information about element overrides can be found [here](https://github.com/trainb0y/FabriHUD/blob/main/Overrides.md).
